Instructions
============

Edit the `Makefile`, commenting and uncommenting lines as required to match
your compiler. Examples are provided that have been tested with GCC 7.3.0 and
Clang 6.0.1 on FreeBSD 12.

After the `Makefile` is configured, simply run `make clean run` to build and
execute the program.
